          "translation": "Lady of all me, resplendent daylight",
          "explanation": "The first two words of the poem, nin and me, are both keywords that play a crucial role throughout the text. The word nin, 'lady,' recurs at regular frequencies, mostly to open or close a section of the poem. Note that šar2, 'all,' can also mean 'countless.' One manuscript renders the line as: 'lady of sweet (du10) me'; this is likely due to a graphic confusion of the two signs šar2 and du10, which look almost identical."

          "translation": "Righteous woman, laden with a terrifying light, loved by An and Urash",
          "explanation": "An and Urash are the deified forms of heaven and earth, respectively. The me-lam2 is the awe-inducing halo of light that surrounds gods and other supernatural beings. Zgoll (301–302) notes that the signs munus zi, 'righteous woman,' also form an archaic spelling of the word zirru, which was one of Enheduana’s titles as high priestess. The writing of the word zirru had since changed into nunuz-zi, but it is possible that the older form lingered in the background, instilling a connection between Inana and Enheduana herself."

          "translation": "nugig of An, she of the great jewels",
          "explanation": "The nugig was originally a designation for a wetnurse or midwife, often of high status and sometimes affiliated with a temple. It is used as an epithet for Inana and other goddesses, but its meaning was confused already in antiquity: for the history of the term, see Brisch. The reading of the signs MUŠ3 KEŠ2 is unclear. Zgoll, Foster, and Black et al. take it to mean 'pectoral jewels,' an emblem of power worn on the breast. Attinger understands it as 'bound' (keše2) 'coronets' (suh10): the phrase would then mean 'she to whom the great coronets are bound,' that is, 'she who holds the great coronets.'"

          "translation": "she who loves the righteous crown, who is suitable for en-ship",
          "explanation": "The en-ship can refer to the position of either a political ruler or a high priestess—en can mean both. The second part of the line is here taken to describe Inana, but it could also describe the crown, as in: 'She who loves the righteous crown that befits the high priestess.' The ambiguity may be intentional, again implying a connection between Inana and Enheduana herself, who was the en of Nanna."

          "explanation": "Since kur can also mean 'foreign land,' the line may refer to Inana as a destructive force descending upon the enemy, but the preposition -ta, 'from,' makes it more likely that mountains are meant."

          "explanation": "Much as with the me, the 'rites' mentioned in this line are best understood as activities that must be performed over and over again to keep the cosmos aright: other possible translations of biluda include 'duties' and 'ordinances.' The line thus makes the point that Inana plays a crucial, but unfathomable role in maintaining the world order—including the destruction of enemy lands. Note also the play on the syllable zu, which means first 'your' and then 'to know' (another play on the same syllable comes in l. 27)."

In the previous line, the second-to-last word was aba,'who'; here, that same sound is split into two words, a2, 'force,' and the prefix ba– in 'you give.'
